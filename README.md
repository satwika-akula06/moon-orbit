# Moon Orbit Animation 🌙🪐

This project visually simulates the moon orbiting the Earth using HTML and CSS only. It's a fun and educational way to learn about CSS animations, positioning, and transforms.

## 💡 Features

- Centered Earth using `position: absolute`
- Animated moon orbit using `@keyframes`
- Smooth continuous rotation
- Responsive layout centered on the screen

## 📁 File Structure

moon-orbit/
│

├── index.html # Main HTML file

├── styles.css # Styling and animation logic

└── README.md # Project documentation


## 🧱 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Transforms, Keyframes)

## 🛠 How It Works

- The `.space` container is relatively positioned to hold the Earth and moon.
- `.earth` is centered using `top: 50%` and `left: 50%` with `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)`.
- `.moon` is placed at the top center of the orbit using `left: 50%` and `transform: translateX(-50%)`.
- The `.orbit` div rotates via the `orbit` animation to make the moon revolve around the Earth.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Watch the moon orbit the Earth! 🌍🌕
